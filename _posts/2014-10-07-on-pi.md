Given that my last post was about floating point I thought this comic strip was very apropos, and it also introduces
the topic of \\(\\pi\\) which is worth a post of its own.

So much has been written about \\(\\pi\\) already, and it's probably the most broadly known mathematical constant, but for
those (hopefully few) who don't know what it is I refer you to this button ...

The ratio of the circumference of a circle to it's diameter is a constant that is the same for any size circle.  This
constant has been known since antiquity and is represented by the greek letter \\(\\pi\\) (pronounced pie).  It is an
irrational, and transcendental, number whose decimal representation is \\(3.141592...\\).

Now, why does the definition involve the diameter of the circle as opposed to the radius?  This is a question around
which there is some controversy and there are people who are firm believers that \\(\\pi\\)
[is wrong](http://www.tauday.com/) and instead we should use the number \\(6.283185...\\) that they represent by the greek
letter \\(\\tau\\) (pronounced tau).

Most people can quote you the first few digits of \\(\\pi\\) (\\(3.141592...\\)), and to many that "is" \\(\\pi\\), but of
course we know (as we learnt in my post about [floating point](/blog/2014/09/24/on-floating-point) it is but one
possible representation, namely the base 10 positional notation representation.  We can represent \\(\\pi\\) in different
bases as we can any number.  Here are a few alternative representations:
