  The paged linked to here may argue that 'the LEGO Group has no authority over the English language to regulate it in
  this way' but I don't care.  The word Legos is an abomination that must be scoured from the face of the Earth.

For the last time, it's LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> damnit!  A LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> set generally contains many
LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> bricks although most people, as I know from personal experience, just end up with a big old box
of LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> that gets tipped out on to the floor for play.  And then when you step on a
LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> brick in your bare feet it hurts like hell and you hop around for a while desperately trying not
to land on any more LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup>.
