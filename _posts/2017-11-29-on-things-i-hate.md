"Not that I condone vandalism, or any -ism for that matter.  -Isms in my opinion are not good.  A person should not
believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself.  I quote John Lennon, 'I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in
me.'  Good point there.  After all, he was the walrus.  I could be the walrus.  I'd still have to bum rides off people."
