  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad.  I got sunshine in a bag.  I'm useless but not for long.  The future is coming on.

# What do you do when you get an Arduino starter kit as a gift?

You make a [useless box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQcVcsEraE)!  Yes, I know you can make one of these with just
a servo motor and two switches but you can also program an Arduino to do it.  Why do it the simple way when you can add
complexity?!  Enjoy!
