I saw this old joke again today ...

"What's the difference between a joke and a rhetorical question?"

... and it reminded me of the beauty of the "Intellectual Joke" - a joke that is only funny to those "in the know",
those with a base of knowledge or understanding about certain topics.  I love these jokes.  So I thought I'd compile a
list of a few of my favorites.

Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Noam Chomsky walk into a bar.  Heisenberg turns to the other two and says, "Clearly

Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger are driving together and get pulled over for speeding.  The cop asks Heisenberg
"Do you know how fast you were going?"  Heisenberg replies, "No, but we know exactly where we are!"  The officer looks
at him confused and says "you were going 108 miles per hour!"  Heisenberg throws his arms up and cries, "Great! Now
we're lost!"

The officer looks over the car and asks Schrödinger if the two men have anything in the trunk.  "A cat," Schrödinger
replies.  The cop opens the trunk and yells "Hey! This cat is dead."  Schrödinger angrily replies, "Well he is now."

The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre was sitting in a cafe when a waitress approached him: "Can I get you
something to drink, Monsieur Sartre?"  Sartre replied, "Yes, I'd like a cup of coffee with sugar, but no cream."
Nodding agreement, the waitress walked off to fill the order and Sartre returned to working.  A few minutes later,
however, the waitress returned and said, "I'm sorry, Monsieur Sartre, we are all out of cream - how about with no milk?"
