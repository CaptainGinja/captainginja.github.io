Welcome to the little corner of the Internet dedicated to the random witterings of one Alan Davies.  Now I have to say
"one" since it is, of course, statistically likely that there's more than one person named Alan Davies in the world and
that they have some sort of Internet presence.  In fact I know this to be true since I am one of the unfortunate people
who, at one point in their life, suddenly became one of the unfamous bearers of my name.

I am refering of course to [this gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davies); my
[Michael Bolton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BaMx_n2_hM).  Now I have no reason to resent this particular Alan
Davies.  I've never met the guy.  He's a pretty funny fella, especially on Qi, and he has a lot more hair than I do so
more power to him.  But he's not me.  So if you came here looking for Jonathan Creek then I'm sorry to disappoint you.
This particular Alan Davies is a lot less famous and a lot less rich.  However he still thinks he has some mildly
interesting things to say and this is where he is saying them.

By the way, do you know that the real Michael Bolton did a [parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03lrL9CFWxM) of the
Michael Bolton character in Office Space.  Check it out.
