I love mathematics.  It's logical, universal and beautiful.  I loved mathematics as a child and was naturally good at it
in school.  In fact it was one of the things that defined me as a kid, I was good at math and science.  I didn't work
expecially hard at it, it just came naturally to me and I wanted to learn more and more.  I wanted to know everything.

I grew up in a non-descript family in a non-descript town and went to (I realize now, looking back) non-descript,
mediocre schools.  I wasn't driven to achieve; there was no expectation that I should aspire to attend an elite
university that would act as a stepping stone for me to then move on to an elite career.  I just went to school and
learnt what I was presented with.

I did have the benefit of having some great, fun math teachers though; in middle school (what, in the UK, we called high
school - Redmoor High School in [Hinckley](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shit-hole) to be precise)
there was ?, and then in high school (sixth form college in the UK, specifically the John Cleveland College, also
located in the same Leicestershire idyll) there were Mr Hirst (or was it Hurst?), Mrs Francis and Mr Prince.

I was streamed ahead in middle school and then again in high school; and for the last two years there I was in a tiny
class (with only five kids in total if I recall correctly) where everyone was motivated to learn and so the teachers
could just focus on teaching without having to do general crowd control as well.  There was also a competitive dynamic
between three of us in the class that really drove us on.  I recall it fondly.

In case you're interested, this post's sub-title contains the word mathematics (or a shortened form of it) in the
following languages: American English, British English, Spanish, German, Greek, Russian, Japanese/Chinese, Korean and
Arabic.  Mathematics is truly universal.
