Consider two right triangles: one with angles 45, 45 and 90 degrees; and another with angles 30, 60 and 90 degrees; both
with a side of unit length.  Via some Pythagoras and trig we can calculate the lengths of the other sides and everything
turns out like this ...

From this the values for the sine, cosine and tangent of the angles 30, 45 and 60 degress fall out and we can use the
above diagram as an aide-m√©moire for these common triganometric values.

$$\sin{45^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

$$\cos{45^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

$$\tan{45^\circ} = 1$$

$$\sin{30^\circ} = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$\cos{30^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

$$\tan{30^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$

$$\sin{60^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

$$\cos{60^\circ} = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$\tan{60^\circ} = \sqrt{3}$$
